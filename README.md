# deadly-sins
- The deadly sins in software security. 
- I'm building this project for the software security class at Texas A&M. 
- The concept is similar to [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) of small examples to learn how to build more secure software by starting from the most basic example and progressively becoming more difficult


## Activities
Each activity tries to build on concepts and increase difficulty from the previous example.
1. Show them a vunerable program for example has buffer overflow
2. Ask them to try to write an exploit
3. Write a program that prevents that exploit
4. Test their program against their exploit and our known exploits
